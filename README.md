Hey, I'm Roetzee. I wanted to share my Rust cheat that I worked on a while back so you can take something from it or even use it as a base for something new. This is an internal cheat. Unfortunately, I deleted my Loader for it a long time ago, so I won't be able to share it. The cheat was made for version 2511. It features automatic offset updates and almost perfectly tuned math. Enjoy.

And goodbye, Expensive Rust DLC.
